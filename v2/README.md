# SimplifyModifier Viewer v2 | by MKebsi
This version is broken! Mainly, it was going to simplify mesh vertices using the Progressive Mesh type Polygon Reduction Algorithm intorduced by Stan Melax in 1998. 

This method is similar to Blender's Decemate Modifier. It is amazing how it can reduce the number of vertices per geometry, yet any thing shaped tall will get deformed and many of its main detalis will be removed.

This is why the third version was intorduce and published in the main directory.
